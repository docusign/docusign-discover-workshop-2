# Customer Relationship Intelligence

## Business Question
*"Which relationships drive the most value and risk?"*

## Objective
Gain deep insights into customer relationships by analyzing agreement patterns, lifetime value, relationship complexity, cross-selling opportunities, and concentration risks.

## Tasks

### 1. Multi-Agreement Customer Identification
Identify customers with multiple active agreements.

**Prompt:**
```
Which counterparties have multiple active agreements with us? Show me the customer name, number of agreements, types of agreements, and total combined contract value.
```

### 2. Customer Lifetime Value Calculation
Calculate the total value of each customer relationship.

**Prompt:**
```
Calculate the customer lifetime value by summing all agreement values per counterparty. Rank customers by their total relationship value from highest to lowest.
```

### 3. Relationship Complexity Assessment
Understand which relationships require the most management attention.

**Prompt:**
```
Assess relationship complexity by looking at customers with multiple agreement types, different renewal dates, or varying payment terms. Which relationships are most complex to manage?
```

### 4. Cross-Selling Opportunities
Identify customers who might benefit from additional services.

**Prompt:**
```
Which customers currently only have MSAs (Master Service Agreements) but no associated SOWs or service agreements? These represent potential cross-selling opportunities.
```

### 5. Customer Concentration Risk Analysis
Assess revenue concentration and dependency risks.

**Prompt:**
```
What percentage of total contract value is represented by the top 5, top 10, and top 20 customers? Are we overly dependent on a small number of relationships?
```

## Expected Insights

- **Strategic Relationships:** Identification of most valuable customer partnerships
- **Account Management Priority:** Which relationships need dedicated resources
- **Revenue Expansion:** Customers with untapped potential for additional services
- **Risk Concentration:** Whether portfolio is too dependent on few customers
- **Relationship Depth:** Which customers have integrated deeply vs. single-service relationships

## Follow-up Questions

- Which high-value customers have agreements expiring soon and need retention focus?
- Are our most complex relationships also our most profitable?
- What's the typical path from initial MSA to expanded relationship?
- Should we implement key account management for our top relationships?
- Which customers show patterns of expanding their engagement over time?
- Are there customers we should consider upselling based on their current agreement profile?

## Relationship Management Actions

Based on the analysis, consider:
- **Key Account Program:** Dedicate resources to top 10-20 relationships
- **Cross-Sell Campaigns:** Target MSA-only customers with relevant service offerings
- **Diversification Strategy:** Reduce dependency on top customers through new business development
- **Relationship Reviews:** Schedule quarterly business reviews with strategic accounts
- **Expansion Playbook:** Document successful expansion patterns for replication
- **Risk Mitigation:** Develop contingency plans for concentration risk scenarios
