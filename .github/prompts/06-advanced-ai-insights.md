# Advanced AI-Powered Insights

## Business Question
*"What patterns and opportunities is AI discovering in our data?"*

## Objective
Leverage AI to discover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies in your agreement portfolio that may not be apparent through traditional analysis. Identify opportunities for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making.

## Tasks

### 1. Seasonal Patterns in Agreement Execution
Discover timing patterns in when agreements are signed or renewed.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the execution dates and renewal dates of all agreements. Are there seasonal patterns? For example, do we see spikes in Q4, beginning of fiscal year, or other time periods? What might explain these patterns? Exclude agreements with missing or incomplete date data.
```

### 2. Geographic Clustering Analysis
Identify geographic patterns in your customer relationships.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze agreements by the governing law jurisdiction or counterparty location. Are there geographic clusters? Are certain regions associated with particular agreement types or terms?
```

### 3. Agreement Lifecycle Optimization
Understand typical agreement durations and identify optimization opportunities.

**Prompt:**
```
What are the typical durations of agreements by type? Compare initial term lengths, renewal periods, and total relationship duration. Are there opportunities to optimize agreement terms for better long-term value?
```

### 4. Predictive Renewal Modeling Data Prep
Identify factors that could predict renewal success or churn risk.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze agreements that have renewed versus those that terminated. What characteristics differ between renewed and non-renewed agreements? Consider factors like contract value, payment terms, agreement type, and duration.
```

### 5. Anomaly Detection in Terms and Values
Identify unusual agreements that don't fit typical patterns.

**Prompt:**
```
Identify outliers in the agreement portfolio. Which agreements have unusual combinations of terms, values significantly above or below the norm, or other characteristics that make them anomalous? These may represent special cases or data quality issues.
```

## Expected Insights

- **Temporal Patterns:** Understanding seasonal business cycles and planning accordingly
- **Geographic Strategy:** Insights into regional preferences, requirements, or opportunities
- **Lifecycle Optimization:** Data-driven decisions about optimal agreement structures
- **Churn Prediction:** Early indicators of renewal risk for proactive intervention
- **Quality Control:** Identification of data issues or truly exceptional agreements

## Advanced Analysis Prompts

### Pattern Discovery
```
What unexpected correlations exist in my agreement data? For example, is there a relationship between agreement value and payment terms, or between jurisdiction and agreement type?
```

### Trend Analysis
```
How has our agreement portfolio evolved over the past 12-24 months? Are we seeing trends in agreement types, values, or terms that indicate strategic shifts?
```

### Benchmark Analysis
```
What are the "typical" characteristics of our agreements by type? For each agreement type (MSA, SOW, License), what are the median values, common terms, and standard durations?
```

### Risk Scoring
```
Based on multiple risk factors (short termination periods, unfavorable terms, high concentration, expiring soon), which agreements represent the highest overall risk to the business?
```

### Opportunity Scoring
```
Which agreements or relationships show the strongest indicators for expansion, renewal, or upselling based on historical patterns and current terms?
```

## Machine Learning & Predictive Applications

Consider using these insights to build:

- **Renewal Prediction Model:** Predict likelihood of renewal based on agreement characteristics
- **Value Forecasting:** Project future contract values based on historical patterns
- **Churn Risk Model:** Identify at-risk relationships before renewal deadlines
- **Optimal Terms Recommendation:** Suggest ideal agreement terms based on successful patterns
- **Automated Anomaly Alerts:** Flag unusual agreements for review automatically

## Follow-up Questions

- What percentage of agreements follow our "standard" patterns versus outliers?
- Can we predict which agreements are most likely to renew based on their characteristics?
- Are there leading indicators in our data that predict relationship expansion?
- Which agreement terms correlate most strongly with long-term customer retention?
- What can we learn from our highest-value, longest-lasting relationships?

## Strategic Actions

Based on AI-discovered insights:
- **Playbook Refinement:** Update negotiation playbooks based on successful patterns
- **Resource Allocation:** Focus resources on highest-value or highest-risk opportunities
- **Process Improvement:** Address root causes of identified anomalies
- **Predictive Monitoring:** Implement ongoing scoring for renewal and expansion opportunities
- **Strategic Planning:** Use seasonal patterns for resource planning and forecasting
