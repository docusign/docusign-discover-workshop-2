# Financial Analysis & Revenue Intelligence

## Business Question
*"What's our total contract value and how is it distributed?"*

## Objective
Gain comprehensive insights into your contract portfolio's financial profile, including total value, revenue distribution, top relationships, payment terms, and currency exposure.

## Tasks

```

### 2. Revenue by Agreement Type
Understand how contract value is distributed across different agreement types.

**Prompt:**
```
Break down the total contract value by agreement type (MSA, SOW, License Agreement, Service Agreement, etc.). Which type represents the largest portion of our portfolio value?
```

### 3. Top 10 Highest-Value Relationships
Identify your most valuable business relationships based on contract value.

**Prompt:**
```
Show me the top 10 highest-value agreements in my portfolio. Include the counterparty name, agreement type, contract value, and expiration date.
```

### 4. Payment Terms Analysis
Analyze the distribution of payment terms across your portfolio.

## Expected Insights

- **Portfolio Valuation:** Clear understanding of total contract value under management
- **Revenue Mix:** How revenue is distributed across different agreement types
- **Relationship Priority:** Which counterparties represent the most significant financial relationships
- **Cash Flow Planning:** Impact of payment terms on cash flow management
- **Currency Risk:** Exposure to foreign currency fluctuations

## Follow-up Questions

- Are our highest-value agreements also our longest-term commitments?
- Is there an opportunity to standardize payment terms for better cash flow management?
- Should we consider hedging strategies for significant foreign currency exposure?
- Which agreement types have the best margins or terms?
- Are we appropriately diversified across counterparties, or is revenue too concentrated?
