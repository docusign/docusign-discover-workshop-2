# Legal & Compliance Risk Analysis

## Business Question
*"Where are our legal and operational risks concentrated?"*

## Objective
Identify and assess legal and compliance risks across your agreement portfolio, including governing law distribution, termination clauses, assignment restrictions, payment penalties, and liability caps.

## Tasks

### 1. Governing Law Distribution
Understand which jurisdictions govern your agreements.

**Prompt:**
```
What is the distribution of governing law across all my agreements? Which states or jurisdictions appear most frequently, and are there any unusual or high-risk jurisdictions?
```

### 2. Termination Clause Analysis
Analyze termination for convenience provisions across your portfolio.

**Prompt:**
```
Review all agreements for termination for convenience clauses. How many agreements allow either party to terminate without cause? What are the typical notice periods required?
```

### 3. Assignment Restrictions Audit
Identify agreements with assignment or change of control restrictions.

**Prompt:**
```
Which agreements have restrictions on assignment or change of control provisions? Show me agreements that require consent for assignment and any associated conditions.
```

### 4. Late Payment Fee Policies
Analyze consistency of late payment provisions.

**Prompt:**
```
What late payment fees or interest rates are specified across my agreements? Are these terms consistent, and are there any agreements missing late payment provisions?
```

### 5. Liability Cap Variations
Review limitation of liability clauses for consistency and risk.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the liability caps across all agreements. What are the different cap structures (e.g., contract value, fixed amount, unlimited)? Are there any concerning outliers?
```

## Expected Insights

### Key Risk Indicators

- **Jurisdictional Risk:** Agreements governed by unfamiliar or unfavorable jurisdictions
- **Termination Risk:** Agreements without adequate protection against early termination
- **M&A Risk:** Assignment restrictions that could complicate future transactions
- **Financial Risk:** Inconsistent or missing late payment protections
- **Liability Exposure:** Agreements with inadequate or unlimited liability provisions

## Follow-up Questions

- Are we concentrated in any particular jurisdiction that could create legal risk?
- Do our termination clauses provide adequate flexibility or protection?
- Which agreements would require consent in an acquisition scenario?
- Should we standardize late payment terms across all agreements?
- Are our liability caps appropriate given the nature and value of each agreement?
- Are there agreements that need to be renegotiated due to unfavorable terms?

## Risk Mitigation Actions

Based on the analysis, consider:
- Standardizing key legal terms across agreement types
- Renegotiating high-risk agreements before renewal
- Creating playbooks for acceptable vs. red-flag terms
- Implementing pre-approval requirements for non-standard clauses
