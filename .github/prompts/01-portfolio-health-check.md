# Contract Portfolio Health Check

## Business Question
*"What's the health of our contract portfolio and what needs immediate attention?"*

## Objective
Assess the overall health of your agreement portfolio by identifying expiring agreements, upcoming renewal deadlines, and potential risks that require immediate attention.

## Tasks

### 1. Identify Expiring Agreements
Find all agreements that will expire within the next 90-120 days.

**Prompt:**
```
Show me all agreements that are expiring in the next 90-120 days. Include the agreement name, counterparty, expiration date, and total value.
```

### 2. Upcoming Renewal Notification Deadlines
Identify agreements with renewal notification deadlines approaching within the next 90-120 days and calculate the financial implications.

**Prompt:**
```
Which agreements have renewal notification deadlines coming up in the next 90-120 days? Show me the notification deadline, contract value, and when I need to provide notice.
```

### 3. Calculate Renewal Pipeline Value
Calculate the total value of agreements up for renewal.

**Prompt:**
```
What is the total contract value of all agreements with upcoming renewals or expirations in the next 120 days? Break it down by month.
```

### 4. Find Agreements Missing Financial Terms
Identify any gaps in contract data that could affect financial planning.

**Prompt:**
```
Show me all agreements that are missing contract value or other key financial terms. This could indicate incomplete data entry or non-standard agreements.
```

### 5. Analyze Renewal Patterns
Understand which agreements auto-renew versus require manual action.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the renewal patterns in my portfolio. How many agreements have auto-renewal clauses versus requiring manual renewal? What's the breakdown by agreement type?
```

## Expected Insights

- **Risk Assessment:** Identify which agreements need immediate attention to avoid unintended lapses or auto-renewals
- **Revenue Forecasting:** Understand the potential revenue from renewals in the pipeline
- **Contract Standardization:** Discover opportunities to standardize contract terms and reduce manual overhead
- **Financial Planning:** Ensure all agreements have complete financial data for accurate forecasting

## Follow-up Questions

- Which expiring agreements represent our highest value relationships?
- Do we have sufficient time to renegotiate terms before renewal deadlines?
- Are there patterns in which types of agreements are missing financial data?
- What percentage of our portfolio is set to auto-renew versus requiring action?
